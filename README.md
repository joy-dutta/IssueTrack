# Issue Tracking System 

	Issue tracking system is used to create project list, assign projects to the developer, tester also with their particular roles. Administrator can create the project lists and also can assign manager to a project. A manager can assign a project to a group of developers, testers. Each developer and testers can login to Issue tracking system  to get their assign project and also to keep track of their work progress. 

	This system will design to provide a highly customizable issue tracking web application. It can be easily customized by adding custom fields and drop-downs. Features include customizable workflow, field level permissions, email integration, file attachments and a detailed history view.

	This Egnaro project is in Play Framework. We have used MONGODB as database, RestAPI calls for security purpose. We access DB by using Morphia.
